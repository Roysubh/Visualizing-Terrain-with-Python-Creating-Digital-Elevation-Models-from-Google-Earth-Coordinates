# Visualizing-Terrain-with-Python-Creating-Digital-Elevation-Models-from-Google-Earth-Coordinates
This project demonstrates how to extract coordinates from Google Earth data, generate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using those coordinates, and visualize the resulting terrain in Python. The workflow utilizes various Python libraries for data processing, interpolation, and visualization.
