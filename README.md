# Visualizing-Terrain-with-Python-Creating-Digital-Elevation-Models-from-Google-Earth-Coordinates
Overview:
  This project demonstrates how to extract coordinates from Google Earth data, generate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using those coordinates, and visualize the resulting terrain in Python. 
  The workflow utilizes various Python libraries for data processing, interpolation, and visualization.

Features:
  Extract Coordinates from Google Earth: The project allows you to read coordinates (latitude, longitude) and elevation data from a CSV file.
  Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) Interpolation: Uses IDW interpolation to generate a smooth surface from the discrete data points.
  3D Surface Visualization: Visualizes the resulting Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in 3D using both matplotlib and plotly for static and interactive plots.
  Save Visualizations: You can save the visualized data both as PNG images and interactive HTML files.
  
Requirements:
  To run this project, ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    plotly
    xmltodict
    rasterio

How to Use:
  Step 1: Convert Google Earth KML to CSV
    Google Earth stores data in KML format, but we need CSV to work with it in Python. 
  
  Here's how you can convert the KML data into CSV:
    KML files contain coordinates and elevation data within <coordinates> and <altitude> tags.
    You can parse the KML file and extract the necessary data points (latitude, longitude, and elevation).

  Step 2: Process the Data
    Read the CSV file, extract the coordinates, and perform interpolation using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method to generate a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

  Step 3: Generate and Visualize the DEM
    Then generates a 3D surface plot and saves it as a PNG image. Additionally, an interactive 3D plot can be created and saved as an HTML file for interactive exploration.

  Step 4: Save Results
    You can save the final DEM as a GeoTIFF file for further analysis or use in other GIS software.

Conclusion:
  This project provides a comprehensive workflow for creating and visualizing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from Google Earth data. By converting KML files to CSV, applying Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation, and visualizing the results in 3D, we can generate detailed terrain models from coordinate and elevation data. The interactive visualizations allow for deeper exploration of the terrain, and the results can be saved in multiple formats such as PNG, HTML, and GeoTIFF for further analysis. This approach is valuable for geographic analysis, environmental studies, and other applications that require accurate elevation modeling from geospatial data.
